# Unsafe-Local-Account-Manager
This Python script defines a simple command-line account manager that allows users to store, retrieve, and delete account information (such as usernames and passwords) for various platforms. The account information is stored in a JSON file named "Accounts.txt". However, it's important to note that the security of storing sensitive information like passwords in plain text is highly compromised. In a real-world scenario, sensitive data should be encrypted and stored securely. Additionally, the script could benefit from input validation and error handling improvements to make it more robust.
